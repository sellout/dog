# dog

Short for “compositional document generator”. This is a category-theoretic approach to typesetting (e.g., a functor from the category of document descriptions to the category of PDFs).

Also, grad students can now complain “dog ate my homework.”

## caveat

It will probably never exist aside from this punny description.
